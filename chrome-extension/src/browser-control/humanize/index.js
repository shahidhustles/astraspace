//
// PURE: nothing in this directory touches chrome.*, CDP, or the DOM. Each
// plan*() takes the current state and returns an ordered list of primitive
// steps; extension/background.js has a small executor that dispatches them.
// That split is deliberate — it keeps a few hundred lines of behavioural
// modelling out of the main codebase, and makes all of it testable in Node.
//
// Step kinds the executor understands:
//   { k:"move",  x, y }                          Input.dispatchMouseEvent mouseMoved
//   { k:"down",  x, y, button, clickCount }      ... mousePressed
//   { k:"up",    x, y, button, clickCount }      ... mouseReleased
//   { k:"wheel", x, y, dx, dy }                  ... mouseWheel
//   { k:"kdown", key, code, keyCode, mods, autoRepeat }  Input.dispatchKeyEvent rawKeyDown
//   { k:"kup",   key, code, keyCode, mods }      ... keyUp
//   { k:"text",  text }                          Input.insertText  (the ONLY text source)
//   { k:"sleep", ms }                            delay
//
// THE INVARIANT: randomisation may change WHERE inside a target we land, HOW
// we get there, and WHEN — never WHAT happens. Same element, same text, same
// scroll destination, every time.

 * Speed tiers — the time affordance for humanization.
 *
 * Realism costs wall-clock, so this is a real tradeoff and the numbers decide
 * it. Measured in-browser (page-recorded event timestamps, so no model or MCP
 * overhead in the span), typing 15 characters:
 *
 *   humanize off  211ms   (~14ms/key — the floor: CDP dispatch itself)
 *   fast         1161ms   (~77ms/key)
 *   natural      2033ms   (~136ms/key — genuine human typing cadence)
 *
 * The ceiling is deliberate: an earlier tier measured ~280ms/key (4.2s for the
 * same 15 characters) and was removed. A tier nobody would willingly pick is
 * not an option, it is a trap — the point of a speed setting is to make
 * humanization affordable. `relaxed` is the slowest tier now, and is tuned to
 * stay under that line while still reading as unhurried.
 *
 *   time   scales every delay (approach, dwell, inter-key, scroll ticks)
 *   points scales how many samples a cursor path is drawn with
 *
 * `fast` is the default, because turning humanization on should not cost a
 * multiple of what it saves. It keeps everything that matters — movement
 * before the click, a landing point inside the target, real key events,
 * identical outcomes — with fewer samples and shorter pauses, never none.

//     a nested scrollable under the stationary cursor, which then ate the rest
//     (the page moved 89-109px instead of 400px);
//   - Input.synthesizeScrollGesture fixed that but measures in literal pixels
//     while a wheel event's deltaY goes through the browser's own scaling, so
//     the same request travelled 600px humanized against 400px plain.
// The extension now issues the identical single wheel event either way and
// humanizes only the cursor's approach to the scroll position.
